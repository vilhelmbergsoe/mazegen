# Issues
- [ ] Code is probably very far from idiomatic and is not very pretty as i have never coded in zig before. If anyone that knows zig would like to make it more idiomatic and easier to read, i'd greatly appreciate it.

# Features
- [ ] Add the ability to use iteration instead of recursion so you can watch the generation live
