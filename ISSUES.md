Here are some issues and bugs that i'd like to fix:

- [ ] Code is probably very far from idiomatic and is not very pretty as i have never coded in zig before. If anyone that knows zig would like to make it more idiomatic and easier to read, i'd greatly appreciate it.

Some features i'd like to implement:

- [ ] Add the ability to use iteration instead of recursion so you can watch the generation live
